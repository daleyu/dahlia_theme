# h1 Title

This is a some random text to display how this theme will look on ==Typora==. It has a lot of great support for things like inline code `System.out.println("Typora")`. It has support [^fn1] for inline math like most themes, so you can do things like $\prod _{\text{name}} (\sigma_{\text{dept\_name = "Physics"}}(instructor))$ . You can highlight text that is important by doing ==shift-command-H==

<!--This is what a comment looks like-->
